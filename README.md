lich
====

A port of Wolf Rentzsch's [Lich binary file format](https://github.com/rentzsch/lich/) to Google Go. This is basically just an excuse for me to write some code in golang. If speed, efficiency, or completeness are a big deal for you, you should probably write your own module.

Todo
====

- Add methods to turn lich data into regular Go-types.
- Make an actual parser (!!)
